Fall 2017 term has just begun, and I'm interested in setting some goals for myself. My primary goal is *to write*. 

I get really hung up on writing. I **can** write, but I never want to show it to anyone. I've just picked up *How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing* by Paul J. Silva, and I'm hoping that adding structure to the process of writing will help me to write more and to write contents of better quality. 

* write (at least) one blog post each month
* write a tutorial for something
* publish something on another website
