      <description>This past weekend, the 2017 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference took place in Atlanta, GA at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
My Microsoft DS3 2016 teammate Louise Y. Lai and I presented our poster on our project Airbrb: Predicting Loyalty. The poster session was held Thursday night for two hours, and for those two hours we had a continuous flow of interested people asking us about our project, much to our delight.</description>

      <description>Fall 2017 term has just begun, and I’m interested in setting some goals for myself. My primary goal is to write.
I get really hung up on writing. I can write, but I never want to show it to anyone. I’ve just picked up How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing by Paul J. Silva, and I’m hoping that adding structure to the process of writing will help me to write more and to write contents of better quality.</description>
