      <description>Fall 2017 term has just begun, and I’m interested in setting some goals for myself. My primary goal is to write.
I get really hung up on writing. I can write, but I never want to show it to anyone. I’ve just picked up How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing by Paul J. Silva, and I’m hoping that adding structure to the process of writing will help me to write more and to write contents of better quality.</description>
