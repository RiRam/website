      <description>Today was my first day as a Disney Professional Intern. I attended Disney Beginnings at the Walt Disney Studio Lot in Burbank, CA.
All the interns gathered in Legends Plaza, and then proceeded to a conference room in the Frank G. Wells building. The presentation went over Disney heritage, information about organizational structure, what will be expected of us as interns, and an overview of how to use the online hub.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, the 2017 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference took place in Atlanta, GA at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
My Microsoft DS3 2016 teammate Louise Y. Lai and I presented our poster on our project Airbrb: Predicting Loyalty. The poster session was held Thursday night for two hours, and for those two hours we had a continuous flow of interested people asking us about our project, much to our delight.</description>

The advent of the sharing economy has redefined the way firms do business. Airbnb has led this revolution. With a valuation of $25 billion, it has become the world’s third most valued startup and has more rooms than the world’s largest hotel chain.
