<p>Fall 2017 term has just begun, and I’m interested in setting some goals for myself. My primary goal is <em>to write</em>.</p>
<p>I get really hung up on writing. I <strong>can</strong> write, but I never want to show it to anyone. I’ve just picked up <em>How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing</em> by Paul J. Silva, and I’m hoping that adding structure to the process of writing will help me to write more and to write contents of better quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>write (at least) one blog post each month</li>
<li>write a tutorial for something</li>
<li>publish something on another website</li>
</ul>
