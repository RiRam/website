<p>This past weekend, the 2017 <a href="http://tapiaconference.org/">Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference</a> took place in Atlanta, GA at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://ds3.research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft DS3</a> 2016 teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseYLai">Louise Y. Lai</a> and I presented our <a href="../../../../projects/airbrb_poster_tapia2017.pdf">poster</a> on our project <em>Airbrb: Predicting Loyalty</em>. The poster session was held Thursday night for two hours, and for those two hours we had a continuous flow of interested people asking us about our project, much to our delight.</p>
<p>At the closing banquet, we were awarded 3rd place in the poster competition.</p>
