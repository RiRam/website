<p>Today was my first day as a Disney Professional Intern. I attended Disney Beginnings at the Walt Disney Studio Lot in Burbank, CA.</p>

<p>All the interns gathered in Legends Plaza, and then proceeded to a conference room in the Frank G. Wells building. The presentation went over Disney heritage, information about organizational structure, what will be expected of us as interns, and an overview of how to use the online hub. I-9 documents were collected and ID pictures were taken. Representatives from <a href="https://partnersfcu.org/">Partners Federal Credit Union</a> and Disney Commuter Assistance were there as well.</p>

<p>Following the presentation we took a little tour of the studio lot. The first stop on the tour was just outside Walt’s office in the original animation building. Did you know the adjustable shades on the exterior of the building were designed for adjusting natural light for animation (pre-computer animation of course)? Next, we walked through the tunnel underneath the animation building. The employee commons area was the last stop, ending right at Pluto’s corner.</p>
